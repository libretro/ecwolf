November 17th, 2009

- Music is now using the new resource code.  I actually did this a while ago

- DEMOs use the resource system.  You can have up to 10000 demos now.

  graphic data.  2 bytes for width, 2 bytes for height.  This is done
  on the fly for VGAGRAPH data, but new data must use the new format.

-----------------------------
- The VGAGRAPH, VGAHEAD, and VGADICT are now loaded by the new resource system

  order independance with equal flexibility.

-----------------------------
- Tweaked the volume formula again.  It's a lot simpler now.

December 9th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Re-combined the Adlib slider, only this time with the music volume since I 
  figured out that the adlib player latched on the music channel.  I really 
  don't feel like figuring out how to separate them at the moment.
- Continued work on the Menu code.  In the process I was able to remove quite 
  a few #ifdef SPEARs!  This means ECWolf will use a little more memory, but 
  it is worth it.
- Tweaked the volume formula.
