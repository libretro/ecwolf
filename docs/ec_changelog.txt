-----------------------------
- Removed "Change View" menu (F5 IIRC) and replace it with Doom style in game
  changing with the -/= keys.
- The load/save menus are now using the new system.  Also save slots are
  dynamically created so you're no longer limited to 10.

June 20th, 2009
-----------------------------
- Removed custom menu handlers in favor of the listeners system since it offers
  order independance with equal flexibility.

-----------------------------

  MenuItems.

-----------------------------

December 9th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Re-combined the Adlib slider, only this time with the music volume since I 
  figured out that the adlib player latched on the music channel.  I really 
  don't feel like figuring out how to separate them at the moment.
- Continued work on the Menu code.  In the process I was able to remove quite 
  a few #ifdef SPEARs!  This means ECWolf will use a little more memory, but 
  it is worth it.
- Tweaked the volume formula.

December 6th, 2008
-----------------------------
- Added: Adlib volume slider.
- Added: Volume sliders.  Their values aren't saved yet but at least they are 
  there.
- Rewrote part of the menu code to use C++ classes.
- Using Wolf4SDL v1.6 as a base.
